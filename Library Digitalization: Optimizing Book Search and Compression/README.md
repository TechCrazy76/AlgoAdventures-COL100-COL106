# Library Digitalization: Optimizing Book Search and Compression

Oct 2024

 ◦ Developed a digitization system to retrieve distinct words from book collections, using Mergesort and
 Hashing techniques like Chaining, Linear Probing, and Double Hashing, with Polynomial Accumulation
 Hashing for efficient collision handling
 
 ◦ Achieved O(1) time complexity for insert and find operations by dynamically resizing the hash table when
 load factor exceeded 50%, ensuring space optimization and amortized O(1) insertion
