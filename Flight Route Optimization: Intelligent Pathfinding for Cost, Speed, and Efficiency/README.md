# Flight Route Optimization: Intelligent Pathfinding for Cost, Speed, and Efficiency

Nov 2024

Instructors: Prof. Parag Singla and Amit Kumar — Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi (Course Project)

◦ Developed a flight planner optimizing routes based on fewest flights, lowest fare, or earliest arrival, using
graph-based pathfinding with priority queues and dynamic programming

◦ Achieved O(m) initialization and O(m log m) for route-finding by leveraging efficient memory management,
ensuring scalability and responsiveness for real-world applications
