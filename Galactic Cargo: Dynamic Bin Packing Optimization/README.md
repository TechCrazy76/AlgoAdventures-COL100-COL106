# Galactic Cargo: Dynamic Bin Packing Optimization

Sep 2024

Instructors: Prof. Parag Singla and Amit Kumar — Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi (Course Project)

• Developed a cargo management system using AVL trees to maintain the sorted order of bins, optimizing space utilization and enhancing operational efficiency.

• Implemented the Largest Fit and Compact Fit algorithms for color-coded cargo management, ensuring efficient bin selection based on size constraints with O(logn) time complexity.

• Modeled cargo bins and objects with unique IDs, allowing for efficient tracking of remaining capacities and object assignments while maintaining balanced tree structures.

• Designed a comprehensive system to manage cargo operations, achieving O(log(n)+log(m)) time complexity for adding and deleting objects, ensuring smooth performance under varying cargo loads.
