# Pac-Man Maze Navigator Using Stacks

Aug 2024

Instructors: Prof. Parag Singla and Amit Kumar — Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi (Course Project)

• Developed a navigation system for Pac-Man using stacks to efficiently manage maze traversal and pathfinding within a haunted grid, enhancing gameplay mechanics.

• Implemented a depth-first search algorithm to find the path from Pac-Man’s starting point to the destination, ensuring cells with ghosts are avoided while maintaining a time complexity of O(n×m).

• Modeled the maze using a 2D grid representation, with distinct methods for managing ghost placements and verifying cell occupancy, facilitating dynamic maze adjustments.

• Designed the Navigator and Maze classes to encapsulate functionalities and maintain clean code structure, ensuring effective stack operations for backtracking during pathfinding.
