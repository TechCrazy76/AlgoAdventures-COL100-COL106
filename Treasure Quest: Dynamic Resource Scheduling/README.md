# Treasure Quest: Dynamic Resource Scheduling

Oct 2024

Instructors: Prof. Parag Singla and Amit Kumar — Department of Computer Science, IIT Delhi (Course Project)

• Developed a heap-based scheduling system to manage treasure processing efficiently, ensuring optimal workload distribution.

• Used a min-heap to prioritize treasures, achieving O(log n) time complexity for retrieval and assignment.

• Modeled system state with priority queues, tracking remaining treasure sizes for balanced load among crewmates.

• Designed a scheduling policy that assigns treasures based on load and processes them by priority, maintaining O(log n + log m) for additions and O(n(log n + log m)) for completion times.
